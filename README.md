# A League of Legends Competitive Analysis

League of Legends is the most famous MOBA game in the world, created by Riot Games. Currently, it is one of the most popular games in the world, yet no one has been able to solve League of Legends to it's fullest. Unlike a game like chess, League of Legends is very hard to have a computer to build to win in the game, because it requires a lot of analysis and skill from players that computers currently just don't have. Because of this, League of Legends is very hard to analyze, because there are many ways for teams to win and for teams to lose. In this sense, we wanted to look through competitive League of Legends games in 2022, one of the best years for competitive League.

## Introduction

In this analysis, we wanted to analyze the best of the best: Competitive Games, and we decided to use a recent year, 2022, to show this. In our analysis, we will analyze one specific question that we believe is very important to how winning games, the primary objective of League, is decided:

Does a winning top lane affect the probability of a team winning the game?

This question is especially relevant because we observed (with out eyes) that top lanes often didn't really help a team unless they were doing exceptionally well and could carry the team. Therefore, we wanted to see how often they actually made teams better, and if they did, was it significant to winning in pro-play.


## Options

Hyde includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.


### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.


### Sticky sidebar content

By default Hyde ships with a sidebar that affixes it's content to the bottom of the sidebar. You can optionally disable this by removing the `.sidebar-sticky` class from the sidebar's `.container`. Sidebar content will then normally flow from top to bottom.

```html
<!-- Default sidebar -->
<div class="sidebar">
  <div class="container sidebar-sticky">
    ...
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Modified sidebar -->
<div class="sidebar">
  <div class="container">
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```


### Themes

Hyde ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add anyone of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

```html
<body class="theme-base-08">
  ...
</body>
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/hyde/blob/master/public/css/hyde.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.

### Reverse layout

Hyde's page orientation can be reversed with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
  ...
</body>
```


## Development

Hyde has two branches, but only one is used for active development.

- `master` for development.  **All pull requests should be submitted against `master`.**
- `gh-pages` for our hosted site, which includes our analytics tracking code. **Please avoid using this branch.**
