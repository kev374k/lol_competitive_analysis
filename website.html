        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>League of Legends is the most famous MOBA game in the world, created by Riot Games. Currently,
            it is one of the most popular games in the world, yet no one has been able to solve League of 
            Legends to it's fullest. Unlike a game like chess, League of Legends is very hard to have a computer
            to build to win in the game, because it requires a lot of analysis and skill from players
            that computers currently just don't have. In this sense, we wanted to analyze the best of the best:
            Competitive Games, and we decided to use a recent year, 2022, to show this. In our analysis, 
            we will analyze one specific question that we believe is very important to how winning games,
            the primary objective of League, is decided: </p>
            
            <span><b>Does a winning top lane affect the probability of a team winning the game?</b></span>
        
        <p>This question is especially relevant because we observed (with out eyes) that top lanes
            often didn't really help a team unless they were doing exceptionally well and could carry
            the team. Therefore, we wanted to see how often they actually made teams better,
            and if they did, was it significant to winning in pro-play.</p>
