## Introduction

In this analysis, we wanted to analyze the best of the best: Competitive Games, and we decided to use a recent year, 2022, to show this. In our analysis, we will analyze one specific question that we believe is very important to how winning games, the primary objective of League, is decided:

<strong>Does a winning top lane affect the probability of a team winning the game?</strong>

This question is especially relevant because we observed (with out eyes) that top lanes often didn't really help a team unless they were doing exceptionally well and could carry the team. Therefore, we wanted to see how often they actually made teams better, and if they did, was it significant to winning in pro-play.


## Cleaning and EDA

Hyde includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.


### Cleaning

<body class = "theme-base-08">
Hyde ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

![Hyde in red](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/1831229/42b0b354-7384-11e3-8462-31b8df193fe5.png)

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add anyone of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/hyde/blob/master/public/css/hyde.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.

Hyde's page orientation can be reversed with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
  ...
</body>
```
