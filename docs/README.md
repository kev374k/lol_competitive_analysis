## Introduction

In this analysis, we wanted to analyze the best of the best: Competitive Games, and we decided to use a recent year, 2022, to show this. In our analysis, we will analyze one specific question that we believe is very important to how winning games, the primary objective of League, is decided:

<strong>Does a winning top lane affect the probability of a team winning the game?</strong>

This question is especially relevant because we observed (with out eyes) that top lanes often didn't really help a team unless they were doing exceptionally well and could carry the team. Therefore, we wanted to see how often they actually made teams better, and if they did, was it significant to winning in pro-play.
